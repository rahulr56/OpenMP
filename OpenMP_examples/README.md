# OpenMP_examples

### Description
This assignment aims at designing parallel algorithms using OpenMP in C++. 
The algorithms developed using OpenMP include:
1. Reduce  - Calculate the sum of all the array elements. (Easy one to get used to OpenMP)
2. Numerical Integration - Computes the numerical integration using different schedulers. (Easy tne to get used to OpenMP)
3. Prefix Sum - An algorithm to add the previous array element to its next. ie., ```a[i]=a[i]+a[i-1]``` 
4. Merge Sort - Implement merge sort algorithm using merge sort.
